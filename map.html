  <div class='map-wrapper'></div>

  <p>The Wilde Trials International News Archive highlights North American and European news reports
    on the Wilde trials, and includes representative news coverage from nineteen countries.</p>
  <p>The majority of the reports have been sourced from digitized newspaper collections. These
    include large open-access national collections, as well as multi-title commercial databases.
    Smaller digitised collections devoted to individual titles have also been important sources.</p>
  <p>To ensure a diversity of content, the archive also includes reports from non-digitised
    newspapers. National collections generally prioritise the digitisation of major titles, rather
    than specialist and foreign-language newspapers. As foreign-language newspapers are important
    sites of transnational cultural exchange, many of those that carried reports on the trials have
    been transcribed by hand at collection sites from print and microfilm sources.</p>
  <p>With the exception of a number of American newspapers, whose curation continues, the archive
    includes all the reports related to the trials published by the newspapers in the
    collection.</p>
  <p>News reports differ widely in format across different newspapers, and sometimes even within a
    newspaper. Some reports appear as stand-alone items; others tag on additional late-arriving
    telegraphic dispatches; yet others are aggregated with other news items in longer columns. In
    each case, the archive counts these as single reports.</p>
  <p>Where reports originally appeared in columns containing unrelated news, the unrelated news has
    been stripped from the text. You can follow the link to the facsimile page if you wish to
    consult the news in context.</p>
  <p>The text of the reports has been transcribed as accurately as possible. Original formatting is
    not strictly preserved, as the archive's primary interest is in the text of the report rather
    than its appearance, and the text-sequencing algorithm necessitates some standardisation of line
    breaks and crossheads.</p>
  <p>Many hands have been involved in the transcription and correction process, acknowledged in the
    <a href="contributors.html">Contributors</a> page. Mistakes are inevitable with this number of documents, however, and the
    revision process continues. It should also be noted that the London Star and the Yorkshire
    Evening Post have not yet gone through full revision.</p>
  <p>Each news report includes basic metadata about the newspaper from which it was derived, as well
    as date of publication, word count, and source. If sourced from open-access databases, a link to
    the facsimile is provided. In the case of certain older databases, however, it is not possible
    to provide a direct link to the report.</p>
  <p>For each news report, there is also “document match” metadata provided on the number of other
    matching news reports at the document level, as well as links to those reports. These are
    differentiated by the kinds of similarity measures used to detect matching text: either
    levenshtein or cosine. Levenshtein measures the number of different characters between two
    pieces of text. Cosine measures similarity based on word frequencies in the text.</p>
  <p>Next to each report are match buttons. These show the number of similar paragraphs found across
    the collection from other newspapers. You can follow links that show side-by-side comparisons of
    reports with matching paragraphs.</p>
