  <p>The Wilde Trials International News Archive currently includes
      over 1500 reports published in newspapers from over a dozen different
      countries and in four languages. The collection highlights North
      American and European news reports on the Wilde trials, and continues to
      develop content from digital, microfilm, and print sources.</p>

  <p>The majority of these reports have been sourced from digitized
      newspaper collections. These include large open-access national
      collections such as the BNF's <a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov">Gallica's presse et
        revues</a>, BNE's <a
        href="http://www.bne.es/fr/Catalogos/HemerotecaDigital/">Hemeroteca
        Digital</a>, Royal Library of Belgium's <a
        href="http://opac.kbr.be/belgicapress.php?lang=EN">BelgicaPress</a>,
      UNAM's <a href="http://www.hndm.unam.mx/index.php">Hemeroteca
        Nacional Digital de MÃ©xico</a>, the multi-institutional <a
        href="http://www.dloc.com/?l=en">Digital Library of the Caribbean</a>,
      LOC's <a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov">Chronicling
        America</a>, and NLA's <a
        href="http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/?q=">Trove</a>. Reports have
      also been drawn from multi-title, cross-indexed commercial databases, such
      as Gale Cengage's <a
        href="http://gale.cengage.co.uk/product-highlights/general-reference/gale-historical-newspapers/gale-newsvault.aspx"
        >NewsVault</a>, the <a href="http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk"
        >British Newspaper Archive</a>, and Readex's and the Center for
      Research Libraries' <a
        href="http://www.readex.com/content/world-newspaper-archive">World
        Newspaper Archive</a>. Local collections and databases devoted to
      individual titles have also been important sources.</p>

  <p>The archive also includes reports from non-digitised newspapers.
      National collections generally prioritise the digitisation of major
      titles, rather than specialist and foreign-language newspapers. As
      foreign-language newspapers are important sites for transnational cultural
      exchange and an important part of the archive, many of those that carried
      reports on the trials have been transcribed by hand at collection site
      from print and microfilm sources.</p>
  
  <p>Each news report includes basic metadata about the newspaper from
      which it was derived, as well as date of publication, word count, and
      source. If sourced from open-access databases, a link to the facsimile is
      provided. In the case of certain older databases, however, it is not
      possible to provide a direct link to the report. For each news report,
      there is also metadata provided on the number of other news reports it
      matches at the document level, as well as links to those
    reports.</p>

  <p>The archive includes all news reports on the trials that could be
      found within a newspaper and which were published roughly between April
      and May 1895. A number of American newspapers are an exception: in many
      cases, only reports on Wilde's first libel trial have thus far been
      gathered. </p>

  <p>The format for these reports differs widely across newspapers, and
      sometimes even within a newspaper, raising questions about the ontological
      status of a news report. Some reports appear as stand-alone items; others
      appear as stand-alone items, but tag on additional late-arriving
      telegraphic dispatches; yet others are aggregated with other news items in
      longer columns. In each case, the archive counts these as single reports.
      Where reports originally appeared in columns containing unrelated news,
      the unrelated news has been stripped from the digitised text. Readers can
      follow the link to the facsimile page if they wish to consult the news in
      context.</p>

  <p>The text of the reports has been transcribed as accurately as
      possible. Original formatting is not strictly preserved, as the
      archive's primary interest is in the text of the report rather than
      its appearance, and the text-sequencing algorithm necessitates some
      standardisation of line breaks and crossheads.</p>

  <p>Many hands have been involved in the transcription and correction
      process, acknowledged in the <a href="contributors.html">Contributors</a>
      page. Mistakes are inevitable with this number of documents, however, and
      the revision process continues. It should also be noted that the <i>London
      Star</i> and the <i>Yorkshire Evening</i> Post have not yet gone through full
      revision.</p>
