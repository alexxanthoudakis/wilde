  <p>To date, the Wilde Trials International News Archive  highlights North American and European news reports on the Wilde trials. All reports published by featured newspapers are included, except for a number of American newspapers where only reports on the first libel trial have thus far been gathered. The collection is representative, but by no means exhaustive of the trials coverage.</p> 
  <p>News reports have been reproduced as accurately as possible, text and headings included. Automatic and manual transcriptions alike have been corrected. Reports may have originally appeared in columns containing unrelated news, which has been stripped. Original formatting is not represented, though paragraph breaks have been preserved. Each report has very light xml markup to prepare it for text processing.</p> 
  
  <p>Metadata is provided for each news report, including date, region, word count, and source, as well as match report data. If sourced from open-access databases, a link to the report is provided. In the case of certain older databases, however, it is not possible to provide a direct link to the report.</p> 
  <p>The collection process continues at pace with labour power and access to digital and archival sources.</p>
