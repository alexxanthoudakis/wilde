        <h2>Oscar Wilde Arrested!</h2>
        <p>The Wilde Trials International News Archive gathers news reports covering the three criminal
          trials of anglo-irish playwright Oscar Wilde. Wilde’s three trials were a global media event
          in 1895 and were front page news the world over for nearly a two month period, triggering
          debates about homosexuality, family relations, censorship and press standards, literary
          Aestheticism, and British criminal jurisprudence. Readers can now browse, search, and compare
          news reports from around the world and track how they moved and were transformed across borders
          and languages.
