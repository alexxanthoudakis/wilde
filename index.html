  <h1>Wilde Trials International News Archive</h1>

  <p>The Wilde Trials International News Archive gathers news reports covering the three criminal
    trials of anglo-irish playwright Oscar Wilde. Wildeâ€™s three trials were a global media event
    in 1895 and were front page news the world over for nearly a two month period, triggering
    debates about homosexuality, family relations, censorship and press standards, literary
    Aestheticism, and British criminal jurisprudence. Readers can now browse, search, and compare
    news reports from around the world and track how they moved and were transformed across borders
    and languages.
