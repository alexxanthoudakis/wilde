        <h2>Oscar Wilde Arrested!</h2>
        <p>The Wilde Trials International News Archive gathers international news reports covering the three trials of Anglo-Irish
          playwright Oscar Wilde. Wilde’s trials were a global media event in the spring of 1895, triggering important debates
          about gender expression and sexuality, family relations, press standards, and the principle of art for art’s sake. You
          can now browse, search, and compare news reports from around the world to learn how coverage of the Wilde trials circulated
          across borders and languages.  <a href="about.html">Read more.</a>

      <h3>Future Work</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>We continue to revise and develop the content of the archive. We are experimenting with
          machine learning to curate digitised news reports about the Wilde trials, and will be
          including reports in other languages.</p>

        <p>Additionally, we have been developing algorithms for detecting cross-language text
          sharing, sometimes referred to as translation plagiarism.</p>

        <p>The archive is related to a larger project on Wilde News Abroad.</p>
