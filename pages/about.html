  <p>The Wilde Trials International News Archive gathers international news
    reports covering the three trials of anglo-irish playwright Oscar Wilde
    (1854-1900). These trials were a global media event in April and May 1895
    reported by journalists interested not only in the courtroom proceedings,
    but also in the sensational stories that unfolded around them -- including a
    Piccadilly street fight and a French duel. Lasting nearly two months, the
    trials triggered important debates about homosexuality, family relations,
    censorship and press standards, literary Aestheticism, and British criminal
    jurisprudence.</p>
  <p>The archive currently includes full transcriptions of over 1500 news
    reports (amounting to 644,150 words) that were published in newspapers
    from over a dozen different countries and in four languages. More than a
    repository of digitised reports, however, the archive also enables readers
    to browse, compare, assemble, and analyse the reports in a number of
    different ways. Readers can open an individual report, compare it to similar
    reports, track how it was copied and translated around the world, and link
    it to larger news networks through access to data about the volume and range
    of the news coverage.</p>
  <p>The archive was designed to give readers access to the international
    coverage of Wildeâ€™s three trials, but also to enable them to retrace how the
    news was copied around the world, via telegraphic communication, translation
    services, and sometimes scissors and paste journalism. Drawing on
    computational and machine learning methods in Digital Humanities, including
    custom-designed text-matching algorithms and the 
    <a href="https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/">Google Cloud Translation
    API</a>, the archive offers new opportunities for reading about the trials
    across borders and languages as well as new applications for analysing how
    they became a watershed event in the history of homosexuality and
    international journalism.</p>
  <p>The archive is a work in progress, and continues to revise and develop its 
    content. It is linked to a related project on <i>Wilde Data &amp; Global 
      News</i>. </p>
