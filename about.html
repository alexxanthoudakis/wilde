      <p>The Wilde Trials International News Archive gathers international news reports covering the
        three trials of Anglo-Irish playwright Oscar Wilde (1854-1900).</p>
      <p>These trials were a global media event between April and May 1895, reported by journalists
        interested not only in the courtroom proceedings, but also in the sensational stories that
        unfolded around them -- including a Piccadilly street fight and a French duel.</p>
      <p>Lasting nearly two months, the trials triggered important debates about gender expression
        and sexuality, family relations, press standards, and the principle of art for art’s
        sake.</p>
      <p>The archive currently includes full transcriptions of 1518 news reports (amounting to
        842,439 words) that were published in newspapers from over a dozen different countries and
        in four languages.</p>
      <p>Drawing on computational and machine learning methods in Digital Humanities, including
        custom-designed text-matching algorithms and the Google Cloud Translation API, the archive
        offers new opportunities for reading about Wilde’s three trials across borders and
        languages, and understanding a watershed event in the history of homosexuality and
        international journalism.</p>
      <p>You can browse, search, and compare the reports to learn about when and how news of the
        trials was reported around the world.</p>
      <p>You can also retrace how the coverage was copied, both locally and internationally, via
        news subscription services and telegraph communication, as well as old-fashioned
        cut-and-paste journalism.</p>
