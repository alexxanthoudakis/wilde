    <p>The Wilde Trials International News Archive has been in development since 2014. It is the first database of its kind to gather international news reports covering the three trials of anglo-irish playwright Oscar Wilde. These trials were a global media event in 1895 that triggered debates about homosexuality, censorship and press standards. The archive includes full transcriptions of over 1500 news reports published in newspapers from over a dozen different countries and in 5 languages. Many of these reports have been gathered from digitized newspaper collections, including Gale-Cengage, Gallica, and Chronicling America, among others. Lesser-known foreign-language newspapers are also an important part of this collection, however, and many of these have been transcribed by hand from original print sources, making the archive a rich and unique international news resource.</p>
  <p>In addition to making available to students and researchers news from the past, the Wilde Trials International News Archive offers new models for reading and analysing these reports. Readers can read an individual report, compare it to similar reports, track how it was copied and translated around the world, and link it to larger news networks through access to data about the volume and range of the news coverage. Drawing on computational and deep learning methods in Digital Humanities, including custom-designed text-matching algorithms and Google machine neural translation, the collection promises to change how we read Wildeâ€™s trials and how we make sense of them as a watershed global event in the history of homosexuality and international journalism.</p>
  <p>The archive continues to develop content and is linked to a related research project on <i>Wilde Data &amp; Global News</i>.</p>
