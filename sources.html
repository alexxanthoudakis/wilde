      <p>The Wilde Trials International News Archive highlights North American and European news
        reports on the Wilde trials, and includes representative news coverage from nineteen
        countries.</p>
      <p>The majority of the reports have been sourced from digitized newspaper collections. These
        include large open-access national collections, as well as multi-title commercial databases.
        Smaller digitised collections devoted to individual titles have also been important
        sources.</p>
      <p>To ensure a diversity of content, the archive also includes reports from non-digitised
        newspapers. National collections generally prioritise the digitisation of major titles,
        rather than specialist and foreign-language newspapers. As foreign-language newspapers are
        important sites of transnational cultural exchange, many of those that carried reports on
        the trials have been transcribed by hand at collection sites from print and microfilm
        sources.</p>
      <p>With the exception of a number of American newspapers, whose curation continues, the
        archive includes all the reports related to the trials published by the newspapers in the
        collection.</p>
      <p>News reports differ widely in format across different newspapers, and sometimes even within
        a newspaper. Some reports appear as stand-alone items; others tag on additional
        late-arriving telegraphic dispatches; yet others are aggregated with other news items in
        longer columns. In each case, the archive counts these as single reports.</p>
      <p>Where reports originally appeared in columns containing unrelated news, the unrelated news
        has been stripped from the text. You can follow the link to the facsimile page if you wish
        to consult the news in context.</p>
      <p>The text of the reports has been transcribed as accurately as possible. Original formatting
        is not strictly preserved, as the archive's primary interest is in the text of the report
        rather than its appearance, and the text-sequencing algorithm necessitates some
        standardisation of line breaks and crossheads.</p>
      <p>Many hands have been involved in the transcription and correction process, acknowledged in
        the <a href="contributors.html">Contributors</a> page. Mistakes are inevitable with this
        number of documents, however, and the revision process continues. It should also be noted
        that the London Star and the Yorkshire Evening Post have not yet gone through full
        revision.</p>
      <p>Each news report includes basic metadata about the newspaper from which it was derived, as
        well as date of publication, word count, and source. If sourced from open-access databases,
        a link to the facsimile is provided. In the case of certain older databases, however, it is
        not possible to provide a direct link to the report.</p>
      <p>For each news report, there is also “document match” metadata provided on the number of
        other matching news reports at the document level, as well as links to those reports. These
        are differentiated by the kinds of similarity measures used to detect matching text: either
        levenshtein or cosine. Levenshtein measures the number of different characters between two
        pieces of text. Cosine measures similarity based on word frequencies in the text.</p>
      <p>Next to each report are match buttons. These show the number of similar paragraphs found
        across the collection from other newspapers. You can follow links that show side-by-side
        comparisons of reports with matching paragraphs.</p>
